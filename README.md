# CodeAlpha Hangman Game 🎮🐍

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **text-based Hangman game implemented in Python**, created as part of my **Python programming internship at CodeAlpha**. Hangman is a classic word guessing game where the computer selects a random word and the player attempts to guess it one letter at a time before running out of chances.

The game was developed using fundamental Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, user input, and the `random` module. It provides a simple and fun interactive experience in the command-line terminal.

## 🧠 Game Description
In this Hangman game:
- A random word is selected from a predefined list.
- The player is asked to guess letters one by one.
- Correct guesses reveal the position of letters in the word.
- Incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining attempts.
- The player wins by revealing all letters before running out of tries.

This implementation helps practice Python fundamentals and illustrates how basic logic and game loops can be combined to create an interactive application.
